# iqa_algorithms

Few Image Quality Assessment (IQA) algorithms.
You may also find the wavelet-based IQA algo and its Custom Orthogonal Wavelet from the paper [1]. 
This algo was made to autofocus integrated circuit through infrared microscopy.

- statsToolbox contains several mathematical tools used in image analysis
- imagesToolbox contains several tool used in image analysis & processing
- all other files contains IQA algo. Note that this algo were used to compute image-per-image focus measure and then normalized.
